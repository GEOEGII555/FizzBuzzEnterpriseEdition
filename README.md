# FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition
Welcome to FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition by Quality Enterprise Coding Co LTD. - the company which had the award for being the best totally real company.

Our top priority is performance, code architecture and ease of use. This is why we wrote our product in C++, and never used Java (don't look at the Git commit history, no, don't do it!).

The usage is simple:

## Usage
Run the executable without any arguments to see the help menu. (figure it out yourself, it's very easy).

## Contributing
You can contribute to this totally not satire and fake company by opening a pull request. It's that simple!

## FizzBuzz
For each number:
```
	If it's divisible by 15, output "FizzBuzz"
	If it's divisible by 3, output "Fizz"
	If it's divisible by 5, output "Buzz"
	Otherwise, output the number.
